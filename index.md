# Overview

<!--The Overture project is a community-based project aimed at developing open-source tools to support the modelling and analysis of the design and development of computer-based systems.
The Overture project is focused on supporting the modelling method [VDM: The Vienna Development Method](http://www.vdmportal.org/) which is a set of modelling techniques that have a long and successful history of use in both research and industrial application.-->

The Overture community supports the modelling method *The Vienna Development Method (VDM)* which is a set of modelling techniques that have a long and successful history in both research and industrial application in the development of computer-based systems.

<!-- It does so by providing documentation, teaching material, and at the heart of the project is the development of the Overture Tool. --> 

The *Overture Tool* is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for developing and analysing VDM models. The tool suite is written entirely in Java and built on top of the Eclipse platform.

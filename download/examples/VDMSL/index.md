### AbstractPacemaker
This model is described in VDM-SL as a short, flat specification. 
This enables abstraction from design considerations and ensures 
maximum focus on high-level, precise and systematic analysis. This
was developed by Sten Agerholm, Peter Gorm Larsen and Kim Sunesen 
in 1999 in connection with FM'99.

### ACS
This specification describes the safety requirements involved in adding and 
removing explosives at an explosives storage site. The specification is based 
on United Kingdom Ministry of Defence regulations concerning safe storage of 
explosives, which in turn are based on UN regulations. 
Details of the specification may be found in:   
1. P. Mukherjee and V. Stavridou, "The Formal Specification of Safety 
   Requirements for the Storage of Explosives", technical report DITC 185/91, 
   National Physical Laboratory, 1991. 
2. P. Mukherjee and V. Stavridou, "The Formal Specification of Safety 
   Requirements for Storing Explosives", Formal Aspects of Computing, 
   5(4):299-336, 1993. 
This example is primarily specified using the implicit style in VDM so it
does not have a main debug functionality.

### ADT
This work specifies a number of abstract data types (ADT) in
VDM-SL. This includes single-linked lists, double-linked lists,
queues, stacks and binary trees. In addition this work is initiating a
translation from VDM-SL to Modula-2 so system addressing and dynamic 
memory handing is specified in VDM-SL. This work was done by Matthew
Suderman when he was a student at Trinity Western University in the
Spring Semester, 1997.

### AlarmErr
This is an erroneous version of the alarm example from the VDM-SL
book, John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen, Modelling Systems --
Practical Tools and Techniques in Software Development}, Cambridge
University Press, 2nd edition 2009. This version of the example is
used for illustrating the tool support in tutorial material about
Overture. It is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm system
developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms for an
industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the rules
governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal with
alarms. A comparable model of this example also exists in VDM++.

### Bar
This specification was produced during a VDM-SL course presented by Peter 
Gorm Larsen to ICL Enterprise Engineering in 1994. The modelling of bags 
was one of the exercises the attendees (including the author Kevin Blackburn) 
was confronted with during the course. This specification is mainly 
intended for the purpose of illustrating how bags can be used. This is
modelled using an executable subset and a collection of small tests are
included.

### ConwayGameLife
Conway's Game of Life
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its 
eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

*   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
*   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
*   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
*   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by 
applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed-births and deaths occur 
simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick 
(in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue 
to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

### Crossword
﻿
This tutorial example is taken out of a VDM course given to the students 
of the Diplôme d'Etudes Supérieures Spécialisées en Génie Informatique 
(5th year) at the Université Joseph Fourier. This example uses the implicit 
style of specification of VDM-SL and thus may not be executed with the
Overture debugger.

### DepartureTMI
This is a model of an Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) departure Traffic Management Initiative
  (TMI) with the constraints:
  - a set of flights wish to depart an airport;
  - each flight may only take off from certain runways;
  - each flight has a preferred take off time;
  - each flight has an acceptable take off window;
  - only certain runways are available;
  - runways have a maximum rate at which departures can take place;
  - the TMI runs for a specific time interval.

Within these constraints, the goal is to allocate a take off time and runway to flights
in an optimal manner. This model is making use of some of the newer language features such as set1.

### DFDexample
This specification describes how one can automatically transform Data
Flow Diagrams (DFD) into VDM-SL definitions. It is written as a flat
VDM-SL model in a purely executable style. However, in order to test
it at the top level one needs to construct a large test structure
which essentially is an AST for a DFD. This have been done in the past
but unfortunately the sources for this have been lost. This model was
basis for a paper published as:

"A Formal Semantics of Data Flows Diagrams", P.G.Larsen, N.Plat, 
H.Toetenel, Formal Aspects of Computing'' 1994, Vol 6, December

### Digraph
The specification describes how directed graphs and relations over
such graphs can can tested for relevant properties and manipulated in
different ways. This specification is produced by Janusz Laski from
Oakland University in the USA. Most of the definitions in this
specification can be interpreted.

This model is only an illustration of the problems germane to automatic 
software analysis. To get a better understanding of the scope of the 
analysis consult the text "Software Verification and Analysis, An 
Integrated, Hands-on -- Approach," by Janusz Laski w/William Stanley, 
Springer 2009. A brief online introduction is offered on the Website
www.stadtools.com.

### Dwarf
This is a VDM-SL Specification of the Dwarf Signal Controller. The VDM
model made in this document is inspired by the Dwarf Signal control
system described by Marcus Montigel, Alcatel Austria AG. The model is
not complete in the sense that it does only model the handing of error
situations for lamp L2. This have been presented at a FM Railway
workshop by Peter Gorm Larsen and it has in the past been connected to
a GUI using the VDMTools CORBA based API. Thus it is a fully
executable specification.

### Engine
As with many modern engineered products, the control software developed at Rolls-
Royce is part of a larger system, namely an engine control system, comprising many
electronic, hydromechanical and electromechanical components. The control system
is part of an engine which, in turn, is a component of an aircraft. This VDM model
is made by Greg Holland as a part of his MSc thesis in this area. It is made 
implicitly so it cannot be executed.

### Express
The (building) industry in Europe currently uses the 
ISO-STEP standard to define information models with the 
aim to exchange data about those information models. The 
ISO-STEP standard contains the EXPRESS modelling language 
and several programming language bindings and an ASCII 
neutral format to implement interfaces to those models. 
Unfortunately, industry has not reached consensus on a 
particular information model, therefore multiple models 
exist. This raises the need to migrate instances from one 
model to another and vice-versa, commonly referred to as 
the "mapping". The aim of this exercise was to determine 
the applicability of VDM-SL with respect to these types 
of problems. For more details on the mapping issue down-
loadable copies of two papers resulting from this research 
is available. The example shows a simple VDM-SL abstract 
syntax representation of the ISO STEP part 21 physical 
file format and a transformation process for a particular 
set of abstract syntax instances. It implements a mapping 
between the relational model representation (rmrep) into 
a simple polynomial representation.

### ISO8601
This is a model of dates, times and durations from the ISO8601 standard. It is 
intended as a core library for use  by higher level models that require dates and/or 
times and/or durations. Dates are  based on the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian 
calendar commenced in October 1582, but it is extended backwards to year 1 in the 
proleptic Gregorian calendar, as per ISO 8601.
Times assume Co-ordinated Univeral Time (UTC). Timezones and daylight savings are 
not supported. The granularity of times is to the nearest millisecond.
A duration is modelled as a number of elapsed milliseconds (being the smallest unit 
of time). All functions are explicit and executable. Where a non-executable condition 
adds value, it is included as a comment.

### Library
This specification is for a bibliography database. It has been written
by Anne Maarsel when she was a student working at OECD Halden Reator
Project in the Summer of 1998. Note that this specification can be
improved in various ways. First of all it introduces post-conditions
that are not really adding much value since they are virtually
identical to the explicit bodies. In addition the use of an optional
type instead of <nil> would be appropriate here.

### LUHN
Luhn algorithm
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple
checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers,
IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in US and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers. It was
created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed on
January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.

The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1.[1]
It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against
accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers
use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from collections of random digits.

### NDB
The Non-programmer database system (NDB) is a nicely engineered binary 
relational database system invented by Norman Winterbottom of IBM. The 
formal Specification of NDB was originally undertaken by Anne Walshe, 
who has subsequently documented the specification and its refinement. 
NDB has been used as an example problem for modular specification in 
VDM-SL. However, the version available here is a "flat" specification. 
The postscript file includes a significant description of the validation 
of the specification using execution. Test coverage is not used though.

### Newspeak
The programming language NewSpeak? is a language designed 
specifically for use in safety-critical systems. It employs

are avoided by restricting the syntax of the programming 
language. This is a formal semantics for the language in 
VDM-SL. Details of the language and its semantics:

### Raildir
In this specification a model of interlocking systems is presented,
and it is describe how the model may be validated by
simulation. Station topologies are modelled by graphs in which the
nodes denote track segments, and the edges denote connectivity for
train traffic. Points and signals are modelled by annotations on the
edges, thereby restricting the driving possibilities. We define the
safe station states as predicates on the graph, and present a first
step towards an implementation of these predicates. The model
development illustrates how concepts may be captured and validated for
a non-trivial system. This work was conducted by Kirsten Mark Hansen
work for the Danish State Railways. More about this work can be found

### Realm
﻿This document is simply an attempt to model the basic data 
structures and auxiliary functions necessary to represent 
realms. A geometric realm defined here is a planner graph 
over a finite resolution grid. This example have been 
partly tested and the test coverage information is 
displayed on the postscript version of the document. 
The script used for testing is included among the source 
files. Realms are used to represent geographical data. 
This document is based on: 

Realms: A Foundation for Spatial Data Types in Database 
Systems, Ralf Hartmut Güting and Marcus Schneider, 
Advances in Spatial Databases - Third International 
Symposium, SSD'93, Springer-Verlag, June 1993.

### Recursive
This example is made by John Fitgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen and it
is used in the chapter about recursion in the second edition of the 
VDM-SL book. It contains a number of examples for recursive graph 
structures and functionality over such graphs.

### SAFER
This VDM-SL model is a response to the PVS model of the SAFER system
for NASA austronauts used for space walks used to maneuver back to a
space shuttle. It was made by Sten Agerholm and Peter Gorm Larsen and
published as:

S.Agerholm and P.G.Larsen, Modeling and Validating SAFER in VDM-SL, 
Proceedings of the Fourth NASA Langley Formal Methods Workshop, 
NASA Conference, Publication 3356, September 1997.

### Shmem
This example was produced by Nick Battle and it is used in the VDMJ user
manual to illustrate different features of VDMJ. It models the behaviour
of the 32-bit shared memory quadrants of HP-UX, using a record type M to 
represent a block of memory which is either <FREE> or <USED>, and a 
sequence of M records to represent a Quadrant.

The specification output indicates which allocation policy, first-fit or 
best-fit (or neither), produces the most memory fragmentation.

### Simulator
The simulator specified in VDM-SL in this example is the 
main component of an animation tool designed for use in 
the validation of complex real-time reactive systems 
described using TROM (Timed Reactive Object Model) 
formalism. We include two versions of the specifications; 
Section 2 contains the version in which implicit operations 
are used, and most of the operations are rewritten as explicit 
operations in the version contained in Section 3.

### Soccer
﻿This tutorial example is taken out of a VDM course given 
to the students of the Diplôme d'Etudes Supérieures 
Spécialisées en Génie Informatique (5th year) at the 
Université Joseph Fourier. A first version uses the 
implicit style of specification of VDM-SL and thus may 
not be executed with VDMTools. An explicit version is 
given as an appendix.

### Telephone
This example due to Abrial has been translated from the 
B-notation into VDM-SL. It demonstrates how an event-based 
system may be modeled using the specification language 
of the Vienna Development Method. In the following, 
operations specify the events which can be initiated 
either by the system or by a subscriber (user). An 
implicit style using pre- and post-conditions has 
been chosen, in order to model the system's state 
transitions. The model of the telephone exchange is 
centred around a set of subscribers who may be engaged 
in telephone conversations through a network controlled 
by an exchange.

### Tracker
The tracker example is used in the mapping chapter of the VDM-SL
book by John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen to introduce 
mappings and mapping operators concerns a system for tracking the 
movement of containers of hazardous material between phases of 
processing in a nuclear reprocessing plant. It is inspired by 
the formal model of a plant controller architecture developed 
by Manchester Informatics Ltd. in collaboration with British 
Nuclear Fuels (Engineering) Ltd. (BNFL) in 1995. More can be 
read about this in:

### Traffic
This example is for all small traffic light control kernel presented in the VDM-SL book
of John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen. It was originally inspired by a similar model
made in Z by Paul Ammann. A paper about this written long ago:
 
A safety kernel for traffic light control, Paul Ammann, Aerospace and Electronic 
Systems Magazine, IEEE, February 1996, Volume: 11 Issue: 2, pp. 13 - 19,

### VCParser-master
This example is created by Tomohiro Oda and it illustrates
how it is possible to use higher-order functions in VDM-SL
to create parser elements that can be put together in a 
compositional fashion. This model can be used as a kind of
library that one can play with manipulating strings into a 
VDM AST representation.

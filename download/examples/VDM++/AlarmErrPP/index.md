## AlarmErrPP
Author: John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen


This is an erronerous version of the alarm example from the VDM++
book, John Fitzgerald, Peter Gorm Larsen, Paul Mukherjee, Nico Plat
and Marcel Verhoef. Validated Designs for Object-oriented Systems,
Springer, New York. 2005, ISBN 1-85233-881-4. This version of the
example is used for illustrating the tool support in tutorial material
about Overture. It is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm
system developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms
for an industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the
rules governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal
with alarms. A comparable model of this example also exists in VDM-SL.

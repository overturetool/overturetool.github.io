Review of Action List

VDMTools
--------

See detailed report from Shin Sahara (sent to the overture-core mailing
list) for the latest on VDMTools from Japan.

CSK has become a subsidiary of Sumitomo Company, and CSK will merge with
Sumitomo Computer System Corporation in October 2011. After the merge
CSK will not be able to decide on any strategy regarding VDM - this may
affect the VDM group.

Overture
--------

IDE

See detailed report from Kenneth Lausdahl (sent to the overture-core
mailing list) for the latest news on the Overture IDE status.

PGL proposed a release 1.0.1 soon, based on the number of improvements
made. PGL will propose a series of releases and present these at the WS.

VDMJ

Nick sent the updates to overture-core mailing list.

LB

The LB have approached people to talk about the RM's that have been put
forward, and are now in the Consideration Phase. In addition, the LB
plans to have an informal discussion on the OO issues at the WS.

Release of version 1.0.0

After some initial interest, it has been more quiet lately, and
downloads have also gone down. No additional suggestions for new
initiatives were put forward.

Overture Workshop

John Fitzgerals sent out a status of the 2011 WS to the overture-core
mailing list.

Thanks to the hard work of Ken Pierce the proceedings of the September
2010 workshop in London have now appeared - can be found at
[1](http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/trs/papers/1224.pdf)

PGL proposed to make the Overture WS 2011 proceedings an Aarhus School
of Engineering TR - PGL and SW will pursue that.

AST restructuring plans

Kenneth Lausdahl and Augusto Riberio will lead this effort in June 2011.
Nick Battle will help if time permits. PGL expects two other PhD student
will assist as well.

Publication plans
-----------------

Everybody need to ensure that the Planned Publications page [Planned
Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink") is updated, and that any
published papers are available on the Overture wiki [Overture
Publications](Overture Publications "wikilink")

AOB
---

A new member will join the Newcastle DESTECS team - Carl Gamble - from
June onwards. Carl has a good background in manufacturing engineering
and a PhD in architectural modelling and semantic mismatches. VDM is new
to him. Over the summer, I expect that a student, Martin Mansfield, will
also join the team to work on co-simulation models of the cardiac
pacemaker.

Overture Core members will also be interested to know that the COMPASS
proposal got very good scores at the commission in review, so we are
quite hopeful it may get funded.

Next Meeting
------------

Next meeting is due on May 29th 2011, 1030 CET

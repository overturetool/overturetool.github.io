VDMTools
--------

Status of VDMTools development
:   New version o VDMTools will be released with improvements. Currently
    the VDMTools team is growing up and have lots of new ideas.

Overture
--------

Status of Thomas' work on the Overture type checker
:   Thomas delivered his thesis and the type checker is completed in one
    version but by no means complete, probably it is a candidate for a
    new thesis project.

<!-- -->

Status of Hugo's work on the Overture interpreter
:   Hugo sent a short report on the actual achievements on the Overture
    Interpreter and actually is almost finishing the automatic code
    generation approach which cannot step further until some bug fixes
    are done to the code generator.

<!-- -->

Status of Sander's work on the Overture proof support
:   Sander was traveling back from Newcastle, but sent a status report
    in advance and everyone feels that his work looks very good.

<!-- -->

Mondex and Pacemaker case studies
:   There are abstract and concrete models on the Mondex case-study and
    the team is starting to look at refinement proofs.
:   Modeled Pacemaker in VDM-SL, sequential/concurrent VDM++ and Vice.
    Next step is to work on validation conjectures.

<!-- -->

New students from Minho for Overture
:   There are lots of projects to the new students from Minho university
    with priority to the code-generator, interpreter and type checker.

## Status of ViennaTalk Development

#### Slicing VDM specs when debugging auto-generated Smalltalk code

ViennaTalk displays VDM source when debugging auto-generated Smalltalk code.
VDM slicing operations are added to the Smalltalk debugger so that which parts of the VDM spec contributed to the point of failure. 

#### Support for combinatorial testing and debugging failed tests

ViennaTalk auto-generates Smalltalk code for traces so that failures and errors in combinatorial testing can be debugged on Smalltalk debugger with VDM source.
VDM slicing operation on the Smalltalk debugger highlights possible causes of failures/errors in the VDM source.

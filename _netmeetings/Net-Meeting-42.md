Overture
--------

VDMJ

Nick has started a new branch with a new scheduler implementation with
good progress.

ASTGen

Marcel have been working on a new version of the ASTGen he hope he will
be able to release it very soon for testing.

Overture IDE

-   Refactoring of the entire IDE has started. Here the DLTK framwork
    will be removed and the debug interface redeveloped based on the
    same protocol.
-   Overture IDE has been prepared for release as version 0.2.
-   Examples available for the Overture IDE 0.2 has been update by Peter
    Gorm Larsen, he reports that there now exist almost 100 examples.
    Kenneth Lausdahl reports that a new test tool for examples has been
    made which can check out the examples execute test with a generated
    web page for inspecting the results of testing. (Marcel recommends
    this tool to be made available at the website)

Overture Language Board

Nico Plat: Well we had our 2010 kick-off NM meeting last weekend; quite
productive. Nick will send around the minutes of the LB meeting.

An issue has been moved the the OCP discussion phase, so now it's time
for yu guys to form an opinion on it. One important thing though that
John also e-mailed about is the point of OML language definition
documents. One of the things that we concluded is that we don't really
have a good overview of are the documents and artifacts that actually
contribute to the definition (semantically and otherwise) of the OML, so
we want to inventarise this. Then we can decide what is still missing
and make up road map (word of the year to get these missing parts. When
we are there we will have a much better mechanism for judging the effect
of language issues on the OML. So I would like you all to take 10
minutes later today and make up a list of language deocuments (and other
language artefacts) and send that either to me directly or to
overture\_lb (AT) overturetool.org.

Release status of Overture IDE 0.2

Shin has been testing the IDE with Japan models written in Shift-JIS and
discovered strange conversions between Shift-JIS and UTF-8. He will mail
example model to Kenneth Lausdahl.

Marcel raised a question about what should be included of external
plug-ins in the release (SVN/CVS) which lead to a longer discussion
about how to decide which plug-ins goes into the release.

The discussion will continue offline but Nico raised the concern that we
should see if we could improve the procedure which is used to specify
what goes into the release.

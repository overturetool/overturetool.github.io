VDMTools
--------

Status and development plans for VDMTools version 8.xx
:   Currently released 8.0 RC version including VICE, this version fixed
    many small bugs from IFAD era.
:   The VDM team got 2 new VDM users. The jobs still small, but we think
    this is the important step for VDM.

<!-- -->

Bug reporting for VDMTools bugs
:   Fixed all bugs reported in English.

<!-- -->

Seminar at the end of July in Japan
:   On 23rd and 24th July, VDM seminars will be hold in Tokyo and
    Nagoya. Peter, Marcel and Shin are speakers.

Overture
--------

Status of Thomas' work on the Overture type checker
:   Thesis now defended successfully with the Danish mark 10.

<!-- -->

Status of Hugo's work on the Overture interpreter
:   Studies on the requirements the interpreter need to fulfill in order
    to use Eclipse as an interface were done and on what's the amount of
    effort to be done in the Eclipse side.
:   The conclusions so far are that it would be good to extend the
    specification of the interpreter and thus implementation to add
    functionality required by Eclipse GUI.

<!-- -->

Status of Sander's work on the Overture proof support
:   Sander is writing his thesis and have not developed anything anymore
    since he left Denmark. The estimate on how much it is possible to
    prove is above 60%, from that point on. In the writing pauses Sander
    will try to apply the tool to the RTRI and Pacemaker examples and
    report on the amount of proof that can be automated.

<!-- -->

The MONDEX case study
:   Two mornings (15th and 22nd August) are planned to work on
    refinement between the Abstract and Concrete models. These will
    begin with a short tutorial on proof by John.

<!-- -->

The Pacemaker case study
:   Marcel reported that Tom Maibaum is the professor from McMaster that
    has adopted the PACEMAKER case for the GC6 initiative and they are
    working (with Brian Larson) on setting up an initiative in north
    America for certifying this kind of applications. Basically, the
    Food and Drug Administration will make a standard to which all these
    kind of devices shall conform.
:   A workshop at FM'08 is planned as a side event for FM'08 aiming to
    assess how first responses to the pacemaker challenge would look
    like when trying to conform to this draft standard.
:   With the work done so far we are on the edge and we should try to be
    involved in the workshop planned to FM'08.
:   We decided to try Sander's work to prove part of Hugo's PACEMAKER.

<!-- -->

    -   Test automation
    -   JML coupling

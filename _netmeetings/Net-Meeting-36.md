    will be removed later from the SVN)

    Eclipse make in source files when it cannot resolve the class. (The
    rest of the class files will also be decompiled soon.)
-   Added VDMUtil both vpp and Java. (Java implementation is incomplete)
-   Added IO both vpp and Java. (Java implementation is incomplete)

Umltrans:

-   Updated Vpp to Uml to report classes which cannot be transformed in
    the console
-   Added print of transformed classes and total execution time
-   Added unit test comparing both vpp files and xmi files from the
    transformation with expected files.

Tools (Maven build automation)

-   Vdmt (1.0.3):
-   New goal for creation of VDM Tools project
-   Update to the code generator so it works with large number of
    classes and have build in check sum to insure that only changed
    classes are generated.
-   New goal to generate a log file with the path to all files in the
    project.

Astgen

-   Created a Maven plugin to wrap Marcels AstGen?
-   Added a goal for generating the vpp files from a .ast file in a
    project

eclipse (Christian and David)

No status reported

POTrans (Miguel)

Miguel has created a new subproject named Automatic Proof System (APS)
(svn:core/proofsupport) where he implemented the basic interaction for
the proof system as designed by Sander Vermolen.

-   Action 36/4: Miguel to coordinate a demo of proof support by FM09

VDMJ (Nick)

Nick created a command line client for the DBGp protocol. Nick started
the work on the VICE extension execution (previously it only did VICE
type checking).

Overture Community Process

Note: Language Board = Executive Committee.

LB to be downsized to 5 members. The LB accepted the first three
proposals and they are:

-   International character support for Overture identifiers
-   The introduction of the "reverse" sequence operator
-   Generalising let-be expressions

The proposals will pass through a stage of deliberation and then
execution.

Overture covering several VDM dialects instead of just OML?

Overture will undergo a series of changes to make it more linkable with
the VDM "brand". Dropping the OML name is one of the actions and
avoiding the reference to different dialects might help with citations.
Referring to it as VDM tools: Next Generation could also improve the
visibility of Overture.

Overture will support different VDM dialects. LB is to decide which
changes to the dialect will be supported but anybody is allowed to make
any their own experiments/changes. Rodin Report - Kenneth & Miguel

See overture-core list.

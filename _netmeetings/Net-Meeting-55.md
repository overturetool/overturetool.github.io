    ready)

VDMTools
--------

See detailed report from Shin Sahara (sent to the overture-core mailing
list) for the latest on VDMTools from Japan. VDMT that uses newer
version of Qt can be downloaded as a beta.

Overture
--------

IDE

Nick sent a small report of two bugfixes.

Language Board

LB minutes of the NM are on the, but there has not been much discussion.
Marcel, Kenneth L and Augusto need chasing. The LB considered the role
of a release manager. Peter Gorm Larsen suggested Joey Coleman, who will
start at IHA in October.

AST Restructuring

The parser and TC (type checker) are now separate Eclipse plug-ins bound
with an AST in between. There is one TC error left to fix for all the
old CSK tests. A document will be written once it is working to explain
how it works. The POG (proof obligation generator) and interpreter are
not yet implemented. Currently this work exists as a separate branch but
should be available in Overture 2.0.0 and this will allow more plug-ins
to be written.

Publication plans
-----------------

The following standard message was reiterated: please ensure that the
Planned Publications page [Planned
Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink") is updated, and that any
published papers are available on the Overture wiki [Overture
Publications](Overture Publications "wikilink"). Peter found four
VDM-related papers from Japan that did not seem aware of the current
status of Overture, so efforts will be made to contact them.

AOB
---

John would like to see a discussion at the next NM on ABZ workshop
submissions and Nico would like to discuss when 1.1.1 will be released

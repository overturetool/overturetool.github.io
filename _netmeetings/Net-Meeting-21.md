VDMTools
--------

Status and development plans for VDMTools version 8.xx
:   The VDMTools newest version is 8.0.1b-071011 with some small bugs
    fixed. A part of interpreter code was rewritten for efficiency.
:   There are two new users. Both are still small jobs, one decided to
    use VDM as a detail design specification language. The other
    requires a report on "How to write requirement specification". The
    problem is how to make the requirement specification for plant model
    (physical model) and control software.

Review of Action List

-   41/3: still open. This action is being carried forward.
-   42/1: open: suggestions needed for speakers for each block of the
    september workshop (by e-mail to Nico).

VDMTools
--------

Shin sent out the usual VDMTools report (see overture-core list).
Functions are now static in VdmTools?.

Overture
--------

VDMJ

Status mail sent by Nick.

ASTGen

Marcel have been working on a new version of the ASTGen he hope he will
be able to release it very soon for testing.

Overture IDE

Status mail sent by Kenneth and Augusto. Since the last meeting we have
progressed and just been able to make a very first internal test version
of the new IDE. This version includes most of the features from the
current release 0.2 but still no plug-ins (latex, PO Viewer, UML Trans
etc). which we have assessed to be fairly easy to upgrade.

Overture Language Board

The following language issues are "open" at the moment: - VDM++ Object
oriented issues. A wide collection of issues which have been stalled
because the lack of language semantics documentation. However, these
issues will be subject of discussion during the Overture Workshop in
September. - Invariant functions for record types. Here the LB has
reached a decision and the RM has now been moved to the "Discussion"
Phase of the OCP, which effectively means it should be discussed buy the
Overture Community at large. - Exception handling in interpreter. This
RM has been discussed by the LB but no decision has been reached yet.
Most likely discussion will be restarted following the procedures of the
LBP (in a "fasttrack" way)..

Release status of Overture IDE 0.2

Shin has been testing the IDE with Japan models written in Shift-JIS and
discovered strange conversions between Shift-JIS and UTF-8. He will mail
example model to Kenneth Lausdahl.

Marcel raised a question about what should be included of external
plug-ins in the release (SVN/CVS) which lead to a longer discussion
about how to decide which plug-ins goes into the release.

The discussion will continue offline but Nico raised the concern that we
should see if we could improve the procedure which is used to specify
what goes into the release.

Any Other Business
------------------

SEMAT (suggested by NB): SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory)
is an initiative to reshape Software Engineering such that Software
Engineering qualifies as a rigorous discipline. The initiative was
launched in October 2009. It's interesting for several reasons: it
obviously relates to the formal modelling we aspire to with Overture; it
has a very impressive list of signatories, including Dines Bjorner;
their presentation material has already started talking about formal
methods and VDM in particular; and (most unusual of all) I found out
about this via Fujitsu (UK), who are a corporate signatory, and whose
tools group is interested in the initiative.

September workshop: suggestions needed for speakers for each block by
e-mail.

Next Meeting
------------

To be doodled.

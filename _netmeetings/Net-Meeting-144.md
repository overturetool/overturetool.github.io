##  Status of the Overture Components

#### VDMJ and VDM-VSCode

There continues to be progress in the POG of VDMJ, specifically for operation POs. This is the subject of a paper submitted to OVT-23.

##  Release Planning

#### VDM-VSCode

VDMJ's 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT has quite a lot of new POG functionality now (see above), and a release of 1.5.x is probably overdue. There is a patched VSIX available on the VDMJ release site, with just the VDMJ jars updated.

Review of Action List
---------------------

-   38/2 (strategic research agenda - jsf) : carried forward
-   41/1 (notes on deploying vdm - pgl/mv/jsf/nb) : carried forward,
    however Peter now plans to produce a video (and test this with Nick)
-   44/1 (LB to report on semantics plan - np): carried forward
-   51/1 (VDM Core work - pgl) : new, Peter to contact Erik and try to
    push forward the VDM Core work

VDMTools
--------

See detailed report from Shin Sahara (sent to the overture-core mailing
list) for the latest on VDMTools from Japan.

The Dependable Software Forum (DSF) VDM technical working group
mentioned in the report will start on Mon 28th Feb. The link between
VDMTools and Overture is working (again) in Overture release 1.0.0 (due
out today). Peter suggested Shin's SEC paper should be added to the
Overture publications page.

LB (OO issues and VDM Core)
---------------------------

The OO issues in the community discussion phase have been discussed on
the mailing list, though this has died down again and no conclusion has
been reached. Marcel suggested that email discussions are not the best
way to decide these issues.

No recent progress has been made on the "VDM Core" idea (based on Erik
Ernt's suggestions from the 8th Overture Workshop in 2010), which the
language board noted would probably help with the discussions by
simplifying the problems. There are two examples of VDM Core in the
Overture svn repository: overturesvn\\documentation\\examples\\VDMCore
and a page on the wiki: <http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php/VDMCore>

Nico argued that the OO RMs should be withdrawn if the community cannot
reach agreement. Ken suggested that they could be placed on an "Issues"
list (where the community should aim to make these issues into concrete
RMs). Peter suggested that he wanted the Overture tool to support VDM
Core as a dialect for testing. Ken and Nick were keen to see VDM Core
defined in VDM-SL. Peter has taken an action to move on the VDM Core
work.

Overture
--------

IDE

Overture 1.0.0 is due to be released today, 27 February 2011. There were
a few bugs fixes from RC4, so Nick was keen to see this version tested
before it goes live. Kenneth will complile and tag the 1.0.0 release.
Marcel will generate a single link (through sourceforge) from which
people can download the tool and documentation. Nick has sent the
release note to the mailing list for checking, which Peter agreed to
check. Peter has made an video that has been uploaded to youtube:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTeaOK1ztHY>

It was suggested to announce the release on (at least) the FMNET mailing
list, various LinkedIn groups. People should suggest all possible venues
for an announcement to Marcel, who will update the website, prepare an
email and send it to Overture core for checking.

Bugs should be submitted to the SF bug tracker (though please check
existing bugs first):
<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141350&atid=749152>

Website

Marcel will check the website is up-to-date and ready for the Overture
1.0.0 release. There is now an @overturetool Twitter channel and a
youtube channel: <http://www.youtube.com/user/overturetool>

VDMJ

Nick sent the updates to overture-core mailing list.

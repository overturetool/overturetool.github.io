A list of actions can here found [here](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22action+net-meeting%22)


## Overture Language Board Status


## Status of VDMTools/ViennaTalk



##  Status of the Overture Components

The next release of Overture will include

* Support for [VDM annotations](https://github.com/overturetool/language/issues/46) (currently limited to the Overture command-line interface)
* Improved type checking of struct import/export (VDM-SL only)
* Improved Java code-generation support
  - Limited support for [polymorphic types](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues/691)
  - Support for [renamed constructs](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues/690) (VDM-SL only)
  - Several bug fixes for the code-generator based on LF's work.

##  Release Planning

The next release, which is due June 03, includes several new features and bug fixes (described above). For this reason, we will send out the release candidate (RC) three weeks in advance. This will give us some extra time for testing and possibly send out a second RC, if needed. The release version will be 2.7.0.

## Review Status of the Action List

See [Net Meeting Actions](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action+net-meeting%22)

* 80-1 No progress. PGL will talk with JF about this when he goes to Scotland next month.
* 88-1 PGL and Nico have been discussing the possibility of taking a new position in targeting industrial contracts. The discussion will continue on Github.


## Overture Language Board Status

The minutes from today's LB NM are available at https://github.com/overturetool/language/wiki/Minutes-of-the-LB-NM%2C-26th-June-2016

Nick has developed prototype implementtions of RM35 and RM36. We need help testing them. Follow the links in the LB NM minutes for more information about the prototype implementations.


## Status of VDMTools Development

VDMTools is still moving towards open-source. There will be a meeting in July where many decision related to this will be made.


##  Status of the Overture Components

#### VDMJ

Various small fixes to VDMJ type checker as a result of Paul Chisholm's testing, mostly to do with module import/exports and polymorphic types. Also made some progress with RM35 (the "set1" type) and RM36 ("seq binds") in VDMJ, though changes not applied to Overture as yet.

#### New TEMPO Plotting library

The new plotting library enabled plotting of variables from a VDM model during simulation without modifying the model:

#### VDM++ to TypeScript

The Masters thesis by Peter Holst and Nikolas Bram has been submitted and their work on code generation from VDM++ to TypeScript has been added at the Overture GitHub in their own branch. It includes a number of interesting features. Hopefully we can get the thesis uploaded before Sunday so all of you who are interested can take a look.

#### VDM-SL to C# and the .NET Contract Framework

The Masters thesis by PSteffen Diswal has been submitted and their work on code generation from VDM-SL to C# and the .MET contracts framework has been added at the Overture GitHub in its own branch. It includes a number of interesting features. Hopefully we can get the thesis uploaded before Sunday so all of you who are interested can take a look.

#### The Overture WebIDE

The Masters thesis by Rasmus Reimer and Kasper Saaby has been submitted and their work on IDE for VDM-SL has been completed some time ago, and it will soon be available from one of the AU servers.

#### The Overture C Code Generator

Work on the code generator is currently focused on integrating it with Overture's (F)unctional (M)ockup (U)nit export functionality.  After exporting a model as a source code FMU, the user can upload the FMU to the FMU cross-compilation server (http://sweng.au.dk/fmubuilder) and receive a standalone FMU that can be used in co-simulation on Linux, Mac OS and Windows platforms.

##  Release Planning

A new release is planned for the 4th of July. The release candidate can be found at http://overture.au.dk/overture/development/Build-60_2016-06-25_22-26/ 

As usual, we need testers for all platforms.

##  Community Development

#### Overture TASTE Integration

In the framework of the SOCIS (Summer of Code In Space) 2016, Overture will be integrated into the [TASTE](http://taste.tuxfamily.org/) architecture as a new Application Layer component (more information about the SOCIS call can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/blob/master/socis.md)). Follows the main progresses of the development:

- Overture has been added as new component of the TASTE Development Virtual Machine.
- Progresses in the coupling between the C code generated by vdm2c and the C code generated by [asn1scc](https://github.com/ttsiodras/asn1scc) starting from data structure defined in ASN.1 language as shown in the following image.

On a more wider note, MV just announced in the Language Board meeting that in parallel to the work of Tommaso he will be looking into establishing a full binding from VDM (data types) to ASN.1

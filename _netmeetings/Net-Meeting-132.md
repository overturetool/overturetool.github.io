## Overture Language Board Status

#### RC50 Inconsistency with eq_T and ord_T signatures

The language board needs input from the community with regard to RC #50.
https://github.com/overturetool/language/issues/50

The question is about the signature of functions implicitly derived
from eq/ord clauses of record types. The language board has been
working on this issue, and the discussion needs inputs from language users.

## Status of ViennaTalk Development

#### Major release **Graz**

FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) collaboration support is added. 
FRAM models collaborations as functions/activities in an organization mutually coupled through 6 aspects (input, output, time, precondition, control and resource). Functions/activities in a model can be imported into a VDM source as skeltons of operation definitions, and also operations in a VDM source can be merged into a FRAM model. Traceability between VDM and FRAM is maintained through annotations in VDM and comments in FRAM.

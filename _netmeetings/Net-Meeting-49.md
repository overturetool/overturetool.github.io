LB

The LB NM was devoted to the discussion of the OO issues document.
Proposals from sections 2 and 3 have been reformulated as 4 different
RMs which are now in the Community Discussion phase. Everyone should
read these proposals and comment before the next NM.

Please see:
<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141350&atid=1127184>

Overture
--------

IDE

Overture 1.0.0RC1 needs testing. See detailed report from Kenneth
Lausdahl (sent to the overture-core mailing list) for more information.

Can testers please up update
[Overture\_Platform\_Releases](Overture_Platform_Releases "wikilink") as
they make tests. Bugs should be submitted to the SF bug tracker (though
please check existing bugs first):
<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141350&atid=749152>

Website

Marcel noted that the RC has not been announced on the site (though
previous RCs were). Marcel also thinks that the site needs to be
"sexier" and should seel Overture more. Currently only Kenneth can edit
the site, so Peter will look at extending access for Marcel, who offered
to work on the site.

VDMJ

Nick sent the updates to overture-core mailing list.

SIG Analysis

Marcel noted that the SIG (Software Improvement Group) analysed Overture
0.3.0:
<http://www.sig.eu/en/Research/Community/Student%20Code%20Clinic/> The
question is what is done with the results. Peter is in contact with
Miguel. Nick notes that these types of analysis are best run often (e.g.
every check-in) and it would be good if this could be added to the
toolflow. There is also some old, unused code that could be removed. The
FindBugs eclipse plug-in could also be used. Peter will discuss with
Kenneth about using the open code clinic while considering the
architecture changes to Overture (new AST, splitting up VDMJ etc.).

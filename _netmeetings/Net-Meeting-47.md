list) for the latest on VDMTools from Japan. The latest version is RC25.
The type checker has been modified and Visual Studio 2010 is now
supported.

Overture
--------

IDE

Overture IDE 0.3.0 has been released. A bug/feature request list has
been started and work is being done on improving combinatorial testing
(to include test coverage).

AST

New AST / TC project has some issues, particularly choice of AST
structure to support TC. There is also the issue of whether the project
should target the new / emerging VDMCore semantics or just copy the
current VDMJ functionality / approach. No updates are expected while
Kenneth is on paternity leave.

VDMJ

Nick sent estimates of effort required for resolving the OO issues
raised at the London workshop to the overture-core mailing list.

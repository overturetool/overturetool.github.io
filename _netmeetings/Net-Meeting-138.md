## Review Status of the Action List

See [Net Meeting Actions](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action+net-meeting%22)


## Overture Language Board Status

See associated minutes.

## Status of ViennaTalk Development

Specification slicing has been implemented on Refactoring Browser, and we are preparing for the next major release.

##  Status of the Overture Components

#### VDMJ

Most work on VDMJ has been in support of the QuickCheck tool, testing it with ever larger sets of specifications and improving the LSP protocol support in anticipation of GUI changes to display/interact with counterexamples. Currently, if you run QC on the command line in VSCode, any counterexamples will be highlighted in the spec as warnings; in future, we hope to be able to automatically launch execution of these counterexamples, to let the user explore why they violate a proof obligation.

#### VSCode Extension

No change, but Jonas Lund will joint the effort here to improve the GUI interface for proof obligations (see above).

#### LSP Server


##  Release Planning

##  Community Development

#### The web appearance of VDM 

Status. We keep with the previous plan. All members are requested to open issues on improving opportunities and we as a community should also improve the pages.

#### Overture Traffic

See download stats on [number of installs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=overturetool.vdm-vscode).


#### OVT-22 

Workshop submission to be sent to FM Organization by mid December

##  Publications Status and Plans

Also see [Planned Publications](https://www.overturetool.org/publications/PlannedPublications.html).

It was agreed that people should review and update this page with their planned papers.

The OVT 21 proceedings is out in arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07120



##  Any Other Business

### Next year meetings suggestions:

* 25 Feb
* 26 May
* 25 Aug
* 24 Nov


### Convener role 

Hugo:
It is an honour to do this role, but I have been more
involved in teaching @ AU, thus less able to be on top
of my community tasks. Next year, the challenge continues.
With record student enrolment at AU, my workload will double, 
the Systems Engineering student pool will reach ~200s and the 
Programming Linear Algebra course I coordinate will serve 
~150s students. And I have also major roles in two other massive 
courses at least. Thus, I think it is only fair to disclose in 
advance the following:

If I continue my role as Overture convener, I will be able to coordinate 
the calls to the core meetings and have a major role on OVT workshop 
organization, but I foresee less and less input from my side in the 
community tasks and activities.

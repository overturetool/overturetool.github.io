### Convener role 

Hugo:
It is an honour to do this role, but I have been more
involved in teaching @ AU, thus less able to be on top
of my community tasks. Next year, the challenge continues.
With record student enrolment at AU, my workload will double, 
the Systems Engineering student pool will reach ~200s and the 
Programming Linear Algebra course I coordinate will serve 
~150s students. And I have also major roles in two other massive 
courses at least. Thus, I think it is only fair to disclose in 
advance the following:

If I continue my role as Overture convener, I will be able to coordinate 
the calls to the core meetings and have a major role on OVT workshop 
organization, but I foresee less and less input from my side in the 
community tasks and activities.

## Status of VDMTools Development


SCSK and Sony are still negotiating this.


##  Status of the Overture Components

#### VDMJ

Some updates committed to the VDMJ (command line) GitHub repo to enable combinatorial test expansion to be done iteratively, which enables far greater numbers of tests to be expanded and executed. Bug #490 fixed.

#### Overture code generation

Recently I (PJ) have been doing more work on code generating VDM-SL traces. By generating, or annotating, the generated Java code with JML annotations it is now possible to give verdicts to the code generated trace tests. This new feature is useful for testing the generated code more exhaustively, but it also is useful for executing trace tests much faster. Unfortunaly I don't have any performance metrics for the code generated traces yet, but I hope to have some soon.

For the past few days I've been working on updating the code generated traces to also include detailed information about trace variables. This should make it possible to derive test stems similar to those used internally by the VDM trace interpreter. These stems can be used for filtering large collections of tests statistically based on the "shapes" of the tests. This part does, however, need more development work and testing.

#### RT to C to generation (part of the INTO-CPS project)

A new project has been started on code generating VDM-RT to C. See https://github.com/overturetool/vdm2c  

#### VDMPad

VDMPad is now a part of ViennaTalk, distributed at https://github.com/tomooda/ViennaTalk-doc/releases.

Documentations are https://github.com/tomooda/ViennaTalk-doc/blob/master/README.md

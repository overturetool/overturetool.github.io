Review of Action List
---------------------

The actions are all at Overture on SourceForge.

-   36/3 managing defect reports against the update site - we are
    currently not maintaining the update site only prebuilds of the
    editor. So no changes there
-   36/4 Miguel - proof demo? We all saw the request for help I hope. -
    Kenneth will help creating a a plug-in with a menu on the project
    and an output console
-   37/1: Peter - Who is the newly-crowned Wiki Tzar? Hoping that this
    will be Hans Kristian
-   37/2 Shin & Augusto to address Shin's Overture bugs - the code in
    the new Overture will be all new, so there is no reason to look at
    those bugs (closed)
-   37/3: LB to improve internal operations. (closed)

Then finally 37/4 display stand arrangements, John is paying the fee,
action (closed)

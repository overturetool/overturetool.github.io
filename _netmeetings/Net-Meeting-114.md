## Review Status of the Action List


## Overture Language Board Status

The following people have stated their desire to join the Language Board for 2018:

* Peter W. V. Tran-Jørgensen
* Paul Chisholm
* Ken Pierce
* Anne Haxthausen
* Nick Battle
* Tomohiro Oda
* Luís Diogo Couto

A few things to note:

1. The LB will be formed at the core meeting on February 25th, 2018.

2. We aim to have an odd (yet flexible) number of members for voting reasons. If an even number of people volunteer, an election process will be started at the core meeting on February 25th.

3. The [meeting dates](https://github.com/overturetool/language/wiki/Language-Board-NetMeeting-Minutes#meeting-dates-for-2018) for 2018 have already been planned.

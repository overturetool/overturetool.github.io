Overture Language Board Status
------------------------------

The RM proposing to add the object pattern to the list of patterns in
VDM has been moved to the discussion phase. The discussion was started
via the core mailing list August 3.

Status of VDMTools Development
------------------------------

SS has reported the status of VDMTools to be unchanged.

Status of the Overture Components
---------------------------------

VDMJ

There were the usual trickle of bug fixes in VDMJ since last time:

-   2014-07-25 Disable periodic and sporadic threads for VDM++
-   2014-07-23 Type checker correction for abstract subclass detection
-   2014-07-07 Account for is\_ expressions in and clauses

Combinatorial Testing

We completed a change to the CT evaluation such that the expansion
becomes lazy instead of expanding all test sequences before the first
test is executed. The change makes it possible to run much larger sets
of tests, and has the advantage that evaluation starts immediately.

-   2014-08-08 CT update completed, awaiting development merge.

Testing

-   A new test framework has been added
-   A new module has been added that when finished will test the
    examples we bundle with the tool
-   Tests have been added to exercise the CT runtime code.

Release Planning
----------------

No specific news for this meeting. There may be a release prior to the
end of August, depending on time â€” if not, next release won't be until
early October.

Community Development
---------------------

Web site

-   Overturetool.org have been updated with content from various
    websites to combine this into a single VDM/Overture page
-   <http://www.vdmbook.com/> will be forwarded to overturetool.org
-   <http://www.vdmportal.org/> will be forwarded to overturetool.org
-   The websites should not be dropped entirely since the links are used
    in books.

Publications Status and Plans
-----------------------------

The publication list was reviewed. See [Planned
Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink").

Any Other Business
------------------

The current approach is to initiate the discussion of RMs via the core
mailing list when they enter the discussion phase. There was a small
discussion concerning this approach, and people generally agree that it
would be a good idea to move the discussion to Github instead and use
the new LB tracker.

Overture

-   Code Generation

On the code generator side their is a development version of a C++ code
generator back end from another student at Aarhus. KP is working on an
Arduino (restricted C++) backend and PJ is helping out with that.

-   GUI builder

A tool for automatic generation of user interfaces for VDM models has
been integrated into Overture. Currently, only VDM++ models are
supported. The tool is run as a launch configuration, although
breakpoints are not correctly supported yet. For more about the tool,
see
<http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=icsea_2011_17_20_10244>

Release Planning
----------------

Version 2.1.4 released

Version 2.1.4 was released 20 November, with small bugfixes ([grab it at
GitHub](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/releases/tag/Release%2F2.1.4)),
with the main legwork done by Luís.

Release Process

From watching Luís go through the release process, Joey has noted some
improvements that must be made to the process document, and will deal
with them as time permits. Another not-done-by-Joey release is
tentatively planned for either 2.1.8 or 2.1.10

Version 2.1.6

Expected in the new year.

Community Development
---------------------

Overture Traffic

See download stats on [GitHub](http://overturetool.org/download/)

Analytics for November: <Media:Analytics-november.pdf>.

Interesting Overture projects:

-   Fuyuki ISHIKAWA from NII wish are working on producing a plug-in for
    VDM metrics. NB and LDC have been helpful with that.

<!-- -->

-   At Kyushu University they have developed a “pre-formal” support that
    they will port over to become a part of Overture


Separate Git repository for the Overture documents
--------------------------------------------------

With the migration of the LRM and Language Board issue tracker to a
GitHub repository (https://github.com/overturetool/language), the
examples and all of the documents (with a few exceptions, like release
notes) were migrated to the new repository. Joey announced to the
overture-core list that that should be considered the canonical place
for them, and that bug reports pertaining to the examples should be
submitted there; this was also noted in [Net Meeting
83](Net Meeting 83 "wikilink") minutes with no objection. Marcel has
objected, as there is a preference that that issue tracker only be used
for LB issues.

During the meeting it was decided to use the LB tracker solely for RMs
and not for the LRM. The content of the LB repository moves to a new
documentation repository instead. The Overture repository and the
associated issues tracker will remain unchanged. An action on Joey has
been created - see [Net-Meeting 84](actions.html#Separate)

Publications Status and Plans
-----------------------------

See [Planned Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink").

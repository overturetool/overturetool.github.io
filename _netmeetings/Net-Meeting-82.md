Overture Language Board Status
------------------------------

Landing Page

Is there a defined landing page for the language board stuff?
Specifically, one that explains how to submit an RM, etc.

New action for NB to create a landing page for the LB.

Issues

Future LB issue discussion will take place on GitHub instead of the core
list.

VDM 10 is now the default language for Overture projects. PGL has an
action to ensure that is done in the tool.

Status of VDMTools Development
------------------------------

SS has reported the status of VDMTools to be unchanged.

Status of the Overture Components
---------------------------------

VDMJ

Just one small bug fix this period:

`2014-08-19 Detect spurious trailing tokens in flat specifications`

Code Generator

2 MSc students have started projects on the Overture code generator. One
is working on extending the CG with support for the concurrency
mechanisms. The other is looking at the distribution aspects of VDM and
if they can be code generated too

Release Planning
----------------

Not discussed.

Community Development
---------------------

Overture Traffic

See download stats on
[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/overture/files/Overture_IDE/stats/timeline)
or [GitHub](https://overturetool.org/download/).

The SF download stats seem to be out of date. The downloads from the
main overturetool.org page were at: 256.

Kenneth set up Google Analytics but that's not being properly
disseminated yet. LDC has an action to follow up on this by getting
access and prepping a report for the next NM. NB and HS have also
requested access.

Strategic Research Agenda
-------------------------

Not reviewed at this meeting. Will be discussed next time, after we have
had answers on the EU proposals.

Publications Status and Plans
-----------------------------

Also see [Planned Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink").

Proceedings for the Overture workshop will be ready soon. Final paper is
expected in the coming week and the proceedings will be out soon after.

Discussion has begun on the next Overture workshop and we are
tentatively aiming for FM'15 in Oslo.

The planned publications list was reviewed and is generally up to date.
The In Preparation list needs cleaning but that will be done as soon as
the workshop proceedings are published,

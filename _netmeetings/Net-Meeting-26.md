Review of Action List
---------------------

The actions are all at Overture on SourceForge.

-   24/1 Closed.
-   24/2 Closed.
-   24/4 Find out about Rodin Tool plug-in standards.
-   25/1 Produce plan with Jeremy for final stages of Mondex

New items
---------

Cool new Eclipse features discovered recently

News about the rCOS tool

VDMTools
--------

Status and development plans for VDMTools version 8.xx
:   Nothing to report.

Overture
--------

Overture Parser Update

Nothing to report.

Status of Adriana's work on the Overture Test Automation Support

Adriana made the expanded version of the traces written by the user.

Status of Carlos' work on the Overture Connector between VDM++ and JML

Carlos got the JML parser interacting with his mapper. He will continue
mapping from VDM to JML in VDM++.

Status of Augusto's work on the Overture Proof Obligation Generator

Augusto finished the implementation of the POG, apart from some minor
things involving classes that are not working properly.

New students (Kenneth and Hans Christian)

Kenneth and Hans Christian will development a tool similar with Rose
link from VDMTools. They will extend the overture project with an
eclipse plugin (EMF) for going back and forth between VDM and UML.
Additionally they will take a look at the test trace file and see if it
is possible to pars this file into a UML sequence diagram.

The MONDEX case study

Jeremy and John have discussed a substantial paper on Mondex for FACJ
with Jim Woodcock, who is planning a special issue on Mondex follow-up.
The one thing John would like to show that was not done so far is a GUI
for domain expert validation. John has a student who wants to work in
this area but she is going to be part time and will take long. He is
considering whether he can divert PhD? student resource on this at
Newcastle.

The Pacemaker case study

Pacemaker FAQ is in the wiki at
<http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/wiki/index.php/Pacemaker_FAQ> The head of
wiki is: <http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/wiki/index.php/Pacemaker> John will
give an invited talk on the pacemaker work as part of a GC day
immediately preceding the ABZ conference in London in September. He will
work further on Pacemaker before then.

The POSIX

Improvements were made in proving the proof obligations automatically in
HOL. A vote of thanks to Hugo and Miguel is made for speaking at the GC
workshop - it got the community a lot of good publicity and improved
recognition in the GC community. They liked the way the community is
using the challenges to explore and benchmark different aspects of the
VDM technology. Miguel is preparing a page for the VDMPortal compiling
all the material they have so far.

Any other business
------------------

An Overture Summer School was suggested and it will be discussed in the
next meeting. The members of the Overture community should take an
action to investigate the rCOS plug-ins. A description of the rCos tool
is available on <http://rcos.iist.unu.edu/tool>.

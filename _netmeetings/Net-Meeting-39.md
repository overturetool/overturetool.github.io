support for all three dialects, outline of SL and debug for vdm++.

POTrans (Miguel)

No progress

VDMJ (Nick)

There have been a large number of small fixes to VDMJ since the last
NM - 65 separate SVN updates. Most of them have been small problems that
have arisen as a result of the closer scrutiny the system has had since
the Overture GUI really became usable (say 0.0.4 onwards) - especially
around the time of FM09.

Carlos have not got any further with the testing stuff

Overture Language Board suggestions and VDM10

Returning the first four items to the LB for deliberation. There is one
new item which is being discussed at the moment (pre/post ops). VDM10

point at VDM-10 [Language board
issues](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141350&atid=1127184)

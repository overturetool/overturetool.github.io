VDMTools
--------

Status and development plans for VDMTools version 8.xx
:   Version 8.1 is now available.

Overture
--------

Status of Adriana's work on the Overture Test Automation Support
:   Adriana is starting implementing a combinatorial testing tool for
    VDM++, based on Tobias Tool. She also wrote a theoretical approach
    for Mutation Testing in VDM++. A Mutation Testing Tool will not be
    implemented due to insufficient resources on the Overture.

<!-- -->

Status of Carlos' work on the Overture Connector between VDM++ and JML
:   Carlos overrun all the major theoretical details that kept him for
    starting the implementation of the connection between JML and VDM++.
    He will now start implementing the tool.

<!-- -->

Status of Augusto's work on the Overture Proof Obligation Generator
:   Augusto is trying to find a way of proving function termination
    automatically, including nested functions.

<!-- -->

Possible new students to take new Overture tasks
:   Peter will I try to contact José for potential new students who
    might be interested.

<!-- -->

The MONDEX case study
:   They started this work by concentrating on illustrative proofs of
    correct refinement. There has been slow progress because it all has
    to be done by hand. One can see the state of the proof checking on
    the Wiki page. They still plan to generate a TR including the
    proofs. However, they have decided to make a main focus the
    illustration of test-based validation technology using VDMTools (so
    far the main distinctive selling point of VDM). To that end, Ken has
    been involved in setting up a testing framework which is now
    installed in a local SVN repository (along with the emerging TR).
:   John thinks they can get there in the end but, because this has not
    been a concentrated effort (because of lack of willingness to commit
    concentrated resources) it will not tell an encouraging story about
    VDM. Their lack of proof tools is still a major weakness compared to
    other formalisms. However, their testing support is impressive. The
    work has had a beneficial effect in spreading experience in VDM,
    VDMTools and proof among a wider group here in Newcastle.

<!-- -->

The Pacemaker case study
:   Hugo has so far made the one serious attempt at this study. The
    models were a good start, but they were mainly developed in order to
    illustrate a development methodology rather than to make a
    significant attack on the pacemaker study. Zoe has been looking in
    detail at some of the models (and indeed is now attempting them in
    Event-B) and feels that major revisions would be required if they
    were attempting a serious attack on the study. John's main concern
    is that there is no definite specification of what the challenge
    problem is and, further, how anyone can attempt it without access to
    domain expertise. For the moment, this remains an example used to
    illustrate other things. John sees no prospect of that changing
    unless more people than himself and Zoe commit time and resources,
    and they get some domain expertise.

-   Proposed **ACTION: 24/2.**

The POSIX
:   John will update to the BTrees model that has been adopted into the
    study by Jim Woodcock, based on some old VDM work. José Nuno has a
    small team working in this area and they are also in contact with
    Sander.

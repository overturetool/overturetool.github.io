## Status of VDMTools Development

No major changes.


##  Status of the Overture Components

See release planning for recent Overture changes.

#### VDM2C

We soon plan to release a new version of VDM2C that uses Overture 2.5.4.

##  Release Planning

Overture version 2.5.4 was released on November 10. [This release](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22+v2.5.4%22) contains several bug fixes and enhancements for the core features, and increased coverage of constructs that can be code-generated to Java.

Next release is due by December 11, 2017.

PGL will find new release dates for 2018.

##  Community Development

PGL is trying to reach out to the guys from Taiwan who are working on proving POs using model checking. They use Overture as part of their work, so there is definitely a chance that we could get some collaboration going.

PGL and Tomo (among others) will be attending a INTO-CPS tutorial in Japan.

#### Overture Traffic

See download stats on [the downloads page](http://overturetool.org/download/)

##  Strategic Research Agenda

The Strategic Research Agenda is reviewed every other NetMeeting.

##  Publications Status and Plans

See [Planned Publications](http://overturetool.org/publications/PlannedPublications.html).

##  Any Other Business

It was discussed how many core meeting we should have in 2018. There will probably be around five, in the hope that we can get more people to attend these meetings.

## Review Status of the Action List

A list of actions can here found [here](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22action+net-meeting%22).



## Overture Language Board Status


## Status of VDMTools/ViennaTalk

### Viennatalk

### VDMTools

##  Status of the Overture Components

### Overture and VDMJ

A couple of bugs were fixed in Overture 2.7.4 and VDMJ regarding mutually recursive measure warning messages. See bugs #719 and #720.

A new subproject of VDMJ has been created, called LSP. This implements a Language Server Protocol and Debug Access Protocol server, which provides language services to an LSP/DAP capable IDE, such as VS Code. This enables us to use VDMJ from a fully featured IDE. The feature is currently [available](https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj/tree/master/LSP) for test.

##  Release Planning


##  Community Development


##  Licensing of Overture source code

No progress on Overture licensing as such. But the LSP project looks promising, and provides a way forward where we can link VDMJ and its LSP server in an independent "product" (VS Code extension) without Eclipse license restrictions (I think!)

##  Publications Status and Plans

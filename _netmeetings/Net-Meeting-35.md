VDMTools
--------

Shin sent out the usual VDMTools report (see overture-core list).

Overture
--------

Status for each of the Overture components at sourceforge

traces (Peter)

It was discovered that the specification in VDM which is code generated
does not scale very well when looking at tests in the range of half a
million to a million. Because of this problem it has been chosen to
change the core of the traces to use the VDMJ traces feature.

eclipse (Christian and David)

The editor was built and an update site has been uploaded to
overture.org together with a pre-installed Eclipse for Windows a
discussed in Newcastle at the workshop. [Overture
Sourceforge](Overture Sourceforge "wikilink")

The development environment has been described in a similar style on
[Developer\_Documentation](Developer_Documentation "wikilink") where
it’s possible to install all tools manual or download an Eclipse for
Windows / Linux which is pre-installed. The DLTK problem discovered in
Newcastle has been solved by taking a snapshot of the DLTK update site
and uploading it to overture.org.

POTrans (Miguel)

Since the last workshop Miguel was able to tryout some ideas some of you
provided ffor the interaction between the potrans component and HOL.
Although the solution isn't perfect yet, some progress has been made.

VDMJ (Nick)

Some of the language proposals where implemented though they can be
backed out if not accepted. Several bugs have been corrected.

Overture Community Process

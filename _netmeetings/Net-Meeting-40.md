Review of Action List
---------------------

The actions are all at Overture on SourceForge.

-   38/2: still open. As indicated at the last NM, Marcel and John will
    address this later in January when they are together in Twente in
    late january.

VDMTools
--------

Shin sent out the usual VDMTools report (see overture-core list).

Overture
--------

Status for each of the Overture components at sourceforge

traces

Traces: We are still working on the paper and have made some minor bug
fixes.

Overture IDE

-   The new feature of VDM-10 have been made available through a
    property tab on a project.
-   New launch tab has been made. Now there is no need to select a file
    name anymore, just the class/ module and operation/function. Here a
    number of bugs has been fixed. E.g. starting the debugger with a
    string argument for an operation.
-   The debug launcher now takes a argument for memory in the
    overture.ini into account when starting so we can increase the
    memory allowed for the debug virtual machine.
-   A coverage option has been added to the launch configuration and
    will soon be available when running a VDM model. VDMJ already
    includes all the information.
-   A small test feature has been added to the Overture debug helper
    plug-in to enable generation of latex – pdf document of a model.
-   PO Viewer: Here the GUI has been upgraded so it keeps the same
    numbering even when the filter option is enabled. Additional bug
    fixes has also been made.

Overture Language Board

Only Peter and Nick have stated their wish to be re-elected. Nick will
work on re-establishing the LB for the next NM. Action 40/1.

-   Release Policy

Nick suggested that release policy should be managed via the LB via
"issues" - except for the third-digit builds. There is always an
outstanding release "issue", and developers working to implement it.

**Action (40/2)** on Peter to coordinate a release plan that has the
support of core members and DESTECS. He can start this during the
DESTECS Kick-off but it will have to be discussed with core before being
agreed.

## Review Status of the Action List


## Overture Language Board Status


## Status of VDMTools/ViennaTalk

### Viennatalk
No major change.

### VDMTools
No major change.

##  Status of the Overture Components

### Overture and VDMJ

VDMJ has been updated to support VSCode problems, so mainly in the LSP Server.

A recent change to enable nested block comments was added, though has caused some concern when applied to Overture. This is currently submitted to the Language Board as a [Request for Clarification](https://github.com/overturetool/language/issues/52).

### VDM for VSCode

The "VDM VS Code" extension for VSCode has been released and is now at version 1.0.5. To allow rapid bug fixing, we've adopted the convention that increments in the third digit of the version number indicate "snapshot" builds of the next 1.1.0 baselined release. This means we have been able to get fixes for the several small issues that people have found - the extension automatically updates when a new version is available. The release seems stable and we're encouraging our power users to take a look, to stress the system (ie. Paul, Leo and others).

There are some installation and user instructions in the READMEs [here](https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj/blob/master/lsp/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/jonaskrask/vdm-vscode/blob/master/README.md).

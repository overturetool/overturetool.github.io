## Status of ViennaTalk Development

Code name "Cyprus" has been released.

* https://github.com/tomooda/ViennaTalk-doc/releases
* Drag&Dropping files from Finder/Desktop into a ViennaTalk environment opens corresponding tools.
* ViennaAnimation to abstract execution mechanisms (now interpreter and transpiler) of animation.
* The settings dialog has the Code Generator section to turn on/off runtime type checking and runtime assertion checking.
* VDMBrowser and Lively Walk-Through provides options to use interpreter or transpiler.

##  Status of the Overture Components

The following Overture-specific issues have been addressed:

* Fixes to the standard libraries (see https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues/586)
* The release notes have been updates to include a link to the VDM-10 language manual (see https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues/607)

In addition the number of VDM constructs supported by the C code generator has been extended (work by PJ). Furthermore, Victor is looking into developing garbage collection support to address some of the issus we have with respect to memory management in the generated code. Lastly, Miran is looking into code generation of the distributed aspects of VDM-RT.

##  Release Planning

Next Overture release is due by December 5, 2016.


##  Community Development

#### Overture Traffic

See download stats on [the downloads page](https://www.overturetool.org/download/)


##  Follow up on the Business Canvas session from the Overture Workshop

One way to proceed from here is to identify different subjects and discuss them separately. For example,

* The business model for Overture 
* The video 
* Next steps for Overture development
* Social media strategy
* etc.

NP has prepared a document that contains a number of "How can we?" questions. He will make the document available on the Overture Github page. The photos of the business canvas (the "sticky notes") still need to be summarised. Furthermore, NP will make a summary of the conclusion on the video so we can discuss it at the next meeting.

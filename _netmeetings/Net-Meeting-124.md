## Review Status of the Action List

A list of actions can here found [here](https://github.com/overturetool/overturetool.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22action+net-meeting%22).



## Overture Language Board Status


## Status of VDMTools/ViennaTalk

### Viennatalk


### VDMTools


### VDM for VSCode

A new LSP feature now available which provides VDMJ language services (all dialects) to an LSP/DAP client, such as VSCode. This also enables us to use the @Annotation features of VDMJ as they were intended - ie. errors in annotation comments are highlighted and they execute as intended when a spec is processed. See README and screen-shots at https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj/tree/master/LSP. Note that there are no awkward licence restrictions by taking this route (unlike the Eclipse licence in Overture).

##  Status of the Overture Components

### Overture and VDMJ

**VDMJ** Some nasty (but obscure) VDMJ bugs fixed over the summer - corresponding fixes made to Overture too.

##  Release Planning


##  Community Development


##  Licensing of Overture source code

See comments above regarding licensing and the LSP feature.

##  Publications Status and Plans

See [Planned Publications](http://overturetool.org/publications/PlannedPublications.html).

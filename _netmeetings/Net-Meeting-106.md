#### VDMJ

4.0.0 Build 170303, Improved support for multi-threaded debugging

Support for command-line multi-threaded debugging in VDMJ has always been poor. This fix enables such debugging to be roughly the same as the remote debugging client (ie. Overture's debugger).

#### VDM2C

We (Victor, Peter and Miran) are happy to announce the first major release of the VDM to C code generator.  This version addresses the critical issue of RAM and flash usage on the embedded microcontrollers used in INTO-CPS.  The generated code makes use of a garbage collector, which must be called manually.  Instructions on how to do this are included in the [release notes](https://github.com/overturetool/vdm2c/releases/tag/Release%2F0.1.0).  This version does not yet include support for the distributed constructs of VDM-RT.  The next release of the Overture FMU exporter will include this release of VDM2C.

##  Release Planning

Overture version 2.4.6 is out. See the [release notes](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/releases/tag/Release%2F2.4.6) for a description of what has changed since the last release.

Next release of Overture, version 2.4.8, is due by June 5, 2017.

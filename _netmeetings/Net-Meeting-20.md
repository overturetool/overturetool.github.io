Review of Action List
---------------------

The actions are all at Overture on SourceForge.

-   13/2 Ongoing: Waiting for new participants.
-   15/2 Ongoing: Thomas is going to write the wiki about the
    TypeCheker?.
-   15/3 Closed.
-   15/4 Closed.
-   16/1 Ongoing.

VDMTools
--------

Status and development plans for VDMTools version 8.xx
:   Shin reported the development plan in this year is:
    -   make VDM++TesK like test case generator prototype

<http://www.ispras.ru/~RedVerst/RedVerst/White%20Papers/vdmtesk/Main.html>

:\*make BIT, BYTE class as standard library

:   Functionality required by an important customer.
:   Actually trying to get the third user from the embedded system
    world, the important point is how to write a requirement
    specification for embedded systems. And, important point in the near
    future is how to connect Simulink models with VDM requirement
    specification.

<!-- -->

Bug reporting for VDMTools bugs
:   Nothing to report, no bug report from Europe.
:   There are some bugs in version 8.0.1b-070820, and dr.k has fixed,
    but he didn't uploaded it yet.

Overture
--------

Status of Thomas' work on the Overture type checker
:   Thomas will be asked to report on wiki.

<!-- -->

Status of Hugo's work on the Overture interpreter
:   Work is finished. The interpreter runs for some cases but further
    development need to be carried on. The interpreter wiki page will
    contain the information needed for the continuation.

<!-- -->

Status of Sander's work on the Overture proof support
:   Sander had network problems, so nothing to report.

<!-- -->

The MONDEX case study
:   Latest report from Jeremy at The VDM Mondex Page. We are progressing
    slowly but things have moved forward in the last couple of weeks
    since John gave a proof tutorial. John is giving much more time to
    this in order to move things forward. Our goal is to have a
    Technical Report on Mondex by November and to try to give a paper on
    Mondex at the GC6 workshop proposed for FM'08.

Wikipedia
---------

John converted the VDM-SL article to interchange syntax and corrected it
in a few places (more corrections may be needed). He also updated the
general VDM article, which was mostly about reification. The two
articles have been merged and the VDM-SL article now auto-redirects to
VDM. Most "double redirects" have been eliminated. References have been
updated.

The merged article now requires considerable smoothing plus:

-   Removal of VDM-SL detail that is already in the textbooks.
-   Writing more interesting material on the particular features of VDM
-   Addition of material on the tools and industrial use
-   Addition of further external links and references.

This is wikipedia, so of course anyone is welcome to make additions and
updates. Peter agreed to provide material on tool support and industry
usage while John's next job is to cut down the language description to
just a discussion of the interesting features.

Anyone is welcome to contribute. If you plan any major changes, let John
know so that duplication of effort can be avoided.

Other Business
--------------

Grand Challenges
:   We will have a regular agenda item on Grand Challenges (Mondex,
    Posix file store, Pacemaker) in future. This is not specifically
    part of VDMTools or Overture but is part of the Strategic Research
    Agenda.

<!-- -->

:   We will look for a champion to progress work on the Posix File Store
    challenge . John F will contact Jose (who has had some students
    working in the area) an also look for support on the vdm-forum
    mailing list.

<!-- -->

:   GC6 is planning a series of Grand Challenge workshops. Current
    proposals are:
    1.  An introductory workshop on the Posix challenge adjacent to the
        ICFEM 2007 conference. Jim made a proposal to the organisers of
        ICFEM (November 2007, Miami, USA) to run an introductory
        workshop on the Posix file store. We are waiting for the
        response. If this goes ahead, John will likely attend the event
        (rather than go to HASE'07 in Dallas where Peter is giving the
        traces paper).
    2.  A workshop adjacent to the BCS-FACS Christmas meeting. Jim has
        not made progress on that but has asked if John would get
        involved in organising it. John will approach BCS-FACS (Paul
        Boca and Jonathan Bowen) to assess the feasibility of holding it
        the day after the FACS workshop. It is believed this workshop
        would also be an attempt to gather interest in the Posix File
        Store challenge.
    3.  FM’08: A series of four half-day workshops on GCs are to be
        proposed for the Monday & Tuesday before the Symposium proper.
        IJim hasn't indicated submission dates but no answer yet.

<!-- -->

VDM at FM'08
:   We agreed to aim to hold a workshop at FM'08. Shin and Peter will
    coordinate the production of the proposal to John Derrick by 18
    November. We decided not to offer a tutorial.

Review of Action List
---------------------

The action item list is maintained as a tracker on
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/overture/netmeeting-actions/).

-   41/​1: Video on Deploying VDM
    -   No progress, remains open
-   59/​1: Reconsider SRA input and structure
    -   No progress, remains open
-   63/​1: set up new SF-based mailing lists
    -   No progress. JC needs to discuss with NP regarding the use of
        West's mail server
-   65/​1: Investigate use of Stack Overflow for VDM community questions
    -   There is now a vdm++ tag on Stack Overflow for questions; JWC
        has submitted a moderation request to make vdm, vdm-sl, and
        vdm-rt synonyms of this.
    -   JWC (and KEL, most likely) are monitoring the site for new
        questions.
    -   We should start spreading the word to people we know that use
        VDM in teaching to have them use Stack Overflow
    -   The main Overture website should also be updated to reflect
        this.

VDMTools
--------

Status of VDMTools development

The VDM++ Toolbox v9.0.2 - Wed 12-Dec-2012 15:28:16 +0900 This version
was improved in Java code generation .

;

Overture
--------

VDMJ

Corrected three small bugs: one to allow @T type parameters to work
correctly with type binds, like "let x:@T in..."; one to correct the
handling of non-integer arguments in set ranges, like {1.1, ..., 3.3}
which is {2, 3}; and one to do with variable values being hidden in
traces under certain (rare) circumstances.

ASTv2/Overture 2alpha

No significant motion on these; JWC has been busy on DESTECS and COMPASS
deliverables

Language Board
--------------

The meeting minutes will be available here:
[1](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php/Language_Board_NetMeeting_Minutes)

LB Election 2013

Every year, the language board is re-elected. A call went out to the
Core email list requesting volunteers to stand. The existing LB members
will stand again, apart from Sune. So we are at least looking for one
new member ideally. Let us know if you would be interested!

Managing VDM Libraries

Marcel made a proposal to the LB that the board should be responsible
for maintaining the libraries that come with Overture/VDMTools (IO,
VDMUtil, Math etc) - defining what operations/functions exist and
defining their semantics. This was not universally agreed by the LB,
though a majority is in favour. It was suggested that we discuss more
widely in Core to seek other views.

It was agreed that the LB is the most practical home for this, since
there is no other formal group that maintains the tool. But it was noted
(JF) that this is not really the intended purpose of the LB when it was
started. Comments passed back to the LB.

Release Management
------------------

Next Release

Overture 1.2.4 will probably be produced in January, but no specific
progress to report.

Strategic Research Agenda
-------------------------

The Strategic [Research](Research "wikilink") Agenda is reviewed every
other NetMeeting.

The EU is formulating its Horizon 2020 programme (the successor to
Framework 7), which will really kick in duing 2014. The unit with whom
we have both DESTECS and COMPASS seems keen to proceed with Systems of
Systems research, but it will probably be labelled "cyber-physical
systems".

Publication plans
-----------------

See [Planned Publications](Planned Publications "wikilink").

No changes were reported at the meeting.

Any Other Business
------------------

None.

Next Meeting
------------

The meeting schedule for 2013 has yet to be agreed.

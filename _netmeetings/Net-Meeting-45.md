See detailed report of Shin Sahara (sent to the overture-core mailing
list) on the latest and greatest on VDMTools from Japan. AIST in Japan
have had very impressive results using VDM++ for a commercial
application.

Overture
--------

IDE

Kenneth and Augusto have worked on a number of changes to the
interpreter to handle VDM-RT in debug mode, this is not finished but now
it can run debugging but still requires lots of resources. Other things
include a better outline, debug interface with deep variable inspection
and change highlights etc. Self update and the normal update manager
have also been enabled. A new 0.3 RC is now available at SF and it needs
to be tested by all Overture stakeholders.

VDMJ

Updated with a thread pool to limit resource usage in VDM-RT model with
a large number of short living threads (Async and Periodic). To ensure
that VDMJ is deterministic, automated test scripts have been made to
execute models on batch mode both command line and through the debug
interface.

LANGUAGE BOARD

The minutes of the language board were briefly discussed. The status of
the upcoming Overture workshop on semantics (13 september at London) was
briefly discussed.

# Manuals

Once you have acquainted yourselves with the basic working of the
Overture tool using the tutorials, it is time to check out the
available manuals, which consist of a language manual (TR-001) and a
user guide (TR-002). There are guidelines for using combinatorial testing (TR-005). Additionally, there is a technical report describing
how the Overture tools can be used as part of an industrial
development process (TR-006). Finally, Overture contains facilities for generating C-code and Functional Mock-up Units according to the Functional Mock-up Interface 2.0 for Co-simulation.

# THE 16TH OVERTURE WORKSHOP: New Capabilities and Applications for Model-based Systems Engineering

The 16th Overture Workshop will be held on 18 or 19 July 2018 (TBC) in association with the [Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) 2018](http://www.floc2018.org/) and the [22nd International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2018)](http://www.fmeurope.org/?p=613).

The  16th Overture Workshop is the latest in a
series of workshops around the Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project
Overture, and related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best established formal methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and practitioners in academia and industry has grown around the modelling languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT, CML) and tools (VDMTools, Overture, Crescendo, Symphony, and the INTO-CPS chain). Together, these provide a platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes static and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking. 

Current projects on model-based design for cyber-physical systems (INTO-CPS and the CPSE Labs experiments TEMPO, CPSBuDi and IPP4CPPS) are generating real results. There are also important developments in Japan with the release of VDMTools under an
open source licence. It is thus timely to focus on the future of the methods and toolchain, improvements in capabilities, and potential applications. We also propose to hold a structured discussion on possible commercial futures. 

Previous workshops have been invaluable in encouraging both new and established members of the community in their work, and helping to determine priorities and future directions. Proceedings of former workshops are available at http://www.overturetool.org/.

### Important Dates

* 8 April 2018: Submission of abstracts of papers  
* 15 April 2018: Submission deadline for papers (PDF only, please)
* 15 May 2018: notification to authors
* 1 June 2018 (TBC): Final version of papers due
* 18 or 19 July 2018 (TBC): Workshop

## CALL FOR PAPERS

The workshop provides a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in formal modelling and analysis using VDM and its family of associated formalisms. We strongly
welcome contributions addressing the development of tools for VDM, developments in foundations, and reports on practical experience. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to: 

* Reports on applications of VDM technology, especially reports of industrial use.
* Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations and case studies of support
tools for VDM (using Overture or other tools)
* Papers on the foundations and methodology associated with VDM and its extensions,
including the description of real-time and distributed systems.
* Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
* Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice.
* Papers on extensions of Overture including Crescendo, INTO-CPS and VDMPad.

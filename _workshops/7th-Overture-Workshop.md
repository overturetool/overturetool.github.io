The Vienna Development Method (VDM, <http://www.vdmportal.org>) is a
well established formal method supported by industry strength tools
(VDMTools). It has a strong record of use as a modeling technique in
commercial applications and as a basis for pioneering research in
model-oriented specification. New insights in tool support, the use of
new technologies promoting interoperability and the potential benefits
of open source approaches all provide strong incentives for developing
next generation tools based on a more open architecture. These issues
are being explored in the Overture Group (https://www.overturetool.org).

After six successful workshops in Canada, the UK, Finland and Portugal
in 2005-2008, we plan to organize the sixth Overture Workshop at FM'09
(http://www.win.tue.nl/fm2009/) on 2 November 2009. The purpose of the
workshop is to foster an active community of researchers and
practitioners working with VDM in both academia and industry.

The VDM and Overture community aims to be open, supportive and welcoming
of new ideas and approaches. We invite contributions in the form of
papers on any subject relating to the foundations, tool support or
applications of VDM or related formalisms. Potential topics for
contributions include, but are certainly not restricted to:

-   The use of VDM in industry (case studies, experiences)
-   Teaching VDM (experiences, course material, examples)
-   The development of VDM tool support
-   Evolution of VDM (language extensions, semantics)

Paper Submission
----------------

Papers should be sent to the organizers in PDF format (maximum 10 pages,
prepared in LaTeX with LNCS style) before July 13th 2009. Notification
of acceptance will be on August 10th 2009. Papers will be reviewed and
accepted contributions will be published as a Newcastle University (UK)
Technical Report at the conference, so camera ready copies will be
required on September 7th 2009.

Papers and presentations will also be published on-line here. A PDF of
your presentation is to be made available to the organizers at the
workshop. At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is required
to be present at the workshop.

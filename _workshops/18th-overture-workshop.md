# THE 18TH OVERTURE WORKSHOP

The 18th Overture Workshop will be held on **07 December 2020** online using Microsoft Teams.

## Registration

To register for this workshop, please email <overture18request@gmail.com> to request the link to participate. 

## Presentations

Each presentation slot lasts 40 minutes. In order to allow time for discussion, no presentation should exceed 30 minutes. 

Authors are invited to record their presentations as video if desired. If you would like to do this, we will arrange for it to be uploaded and played during your slot. We would also welcome presentations that we can subsequently make available online. If you wish to prepare a pre-recording, please contact Tomohiro Oda (<tomohiro@sra.co.jp>) for instructions on how to upload.

# CALL FOR PAPERS

The 18th Overture Workshop will be held on **07 December 2020** online.

The 18th Overture Workshop is the latest in a series of workshops around the
Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and
related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best established formal
methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and
practitioners in academia and industry has grown around the modelling
languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT, CML) and tools (VDMTools, Overture,
Crescendo, Symphony, the INTO-CPS chain, and ViennaTalk). Together, these provide a
platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes static
and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking.

Previous workshops have been invaluable in encouraging both new and
established members of the community in their work, and helping to determine
priorities and future directions. Proceedings of former workshops are
available at <https://www.overturetool.org/>.

## Submission

Submission of papers is through EasyChair: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ovt18>.

### Important Dates

* ~~Full Papers~~Abstract: Friday, October 9
* Full Papers: ~~Friday, October 9~~ Friday, October 16
* Notifications: ~~Friday 6th November~~ Friday, November 13
* Camera ready version of papers: Friday, November 27
* Workshop: Monday, December 7

## Call

Our workshop provides a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in formal modelling and analysis using VDM and its family of associated formalisms including extensions for distributed VDM and real-time systems. We strongly welcome contributions on the development of tools for, as well as developments in, foundations and reports of practical experience. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the PC, must use the Springer LNCS format, and should not exceed 15 pages in length. 

The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to:
* Reports of applications of VDM technology, especially reports of industrial use.
* Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations and case studies of support tools for VDM, whether or not implemented on the Overture platform.
* Papers on the foundations and methodology associated with VDM and its extensions, including the description of real-time, cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems.
* Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice.
* Papers on extensions of Overture, including INTO-CPS and ViennaTalk.

# CALL FOR PAPERS
The 19th Overture Workshop will be held on **22 October 2021** online and in person at Aarhus University if possible.

The 19th Overture Workshop is the latest in a series of workshops around the
Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and
related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best established formal
methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and
practitioners in academia and industry has grown around the modelling
languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT) and tools (including VDMTools, Overture,
INTO-CPS, ViennaTalk, VDMJ and VDM VSCode). Together, these provide a
platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes IDEs, static
and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking.

Previous workshops have been invaluable in encouraging both new and
established members of the community in their work, and helping to determine
priorities and future directions. Proceedings of former workshops are
available at <https://www.overturetool.org/>.

## Submission
Submission of papers is through EasyChair: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ovt19>.

* Pre-proceedings: Monday, October 11, 2021
* Workshop: Friday, October 22, 2021

## Call
Our workshop provides a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in formal modelling and analysis using VDM and its family of associated formalisms including extensions for distributed VDM and real-time systems. We strongly welcome contributions on the development of tools for, as well as developments in, foundations and reports of practical experience. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the PC, must use the Springer LNCS format, and should not exceed 15 pages in length. 

The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to:
* Reports of applications of VDM technology, especially reports of industrial use.
* Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations and case studies of support tools for VDM, whether or not implemented in the VDM-related tools.
* Papers on the foundations and methodology associated with VDM and its extensions, including the description of real-time, cyber-physical systems, digital twins and systems-of-systems.
* Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
* Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice.
* Papers on extensions of VDM-related tools including Overture, INTO-CPS and ViennaTalk.

Date and Location
-----------------

The Fourth VDM-Overture Workshop at FM'08

26th of May 2008, Turku, Finland

Call for Proposals and Participation
------------------------------------

The Vienna Development Method (VDM) is a well established formal method
supported by industry strength tools (VDMTools). It has a strong record
of use as a modeling technique in commercial applications and as a basis
for pioneering research in model-oriented specification. New insights in
tool support, the use of new technologies promoting interoperability and
the potential benefits of open source approaches all provide strong
incentives for developing next generation tools based on a more open
architecture. These issues are being explored in the Overture Group
(www.overturetool.org).

After three successful workshops in Canada and the UK in 2005-2007, we
plan to organize the fourth Overture Workshop at
[FM'08](http://www.fm2008.abo.fi/) on the 26th of May 2008. The purpose
of the workshop is to foster an active community of researchers and
practitioners working with VDM in both academia and industry. The
organizers are PeterGormLarsen of the Engineering College of Aarhus,
Denmark and ShinSahara of CSK Corporation, Japan.

The VDM and Overture community aims to be open, supportive and welcoming
of new ideas and approaches. We invite contributions in the form of
papers on any subject relating to the foundations, tool support or
applications of VDM or related formalisms. [The final programme can be
found here](4thOvertureWorkshopProgrammeV1.0.pdf "wikilink"). Paper
contributions will be published as a Newcastle University (UK) Technical
Report at the workshop, so camera ready copies will be required two
weeks before the workshop.

Papers and presentations will also be published on-line on the Overture
project web-site (http://www.overturetool.org), which currently includes
on-line proceedings of the first three Overture workshops. Camera-ready
copy of your paper and a PDF of your presentation is to be delivered at
the workshop. At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is
required to be present at the workshop.

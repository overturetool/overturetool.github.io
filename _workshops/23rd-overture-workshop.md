## Call for Contributions
We are excited to announce that 11-12th June 2025 will see a joint gathering of two groups active in well-founded model-based methods for Systems Engineering at Aarhus University.  We encourage both papers and presentations presenting work from initial "brainstorm" ideas to publishable maturity in any of the areas covered.   

### The  Overture Workshop 
The **Overture Workshop** features the Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best-established formal methods, its modelling languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT) and tools (including VDMTools, Overture, INTO-CPS, ViennaTalk, VDMJ and VDM VSCode) providing a platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes IDEs, static and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking. Proceedings of former workshops are available at https://www.overturetool.org/.

### The INTO-CPS Association Brainstorm
The *INTO-CPS Association Brainstorm* is a newer informal event that focuses on multi-modelling, co-simulation, and other technologies for model-based design, implementation and deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems and especially Digital Twins. The focus is on the open INTO-CPS tool chain and associated frameworks. Previous workshops and brainstorm sessions have been invaluable in encouraging both new and established members of the community in their work, helping to determine priorities and future directions. 

## Important Dates 

**09th of May 2025 Extended** ~25th April 2025~: Submission of papers and outlines of presentations 

19th May 2025: Notification to authors

8th June 2025: Final version of papers due

11-12th June 2025: Workshop

## Call
Our workshop provides a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in Digital twins, formal modelling and analysis using VDM/Overture or INTO-CPS and their associated formalisms and extensions. We warmly welcome contributions on the development of foundations, methods, tools, and reports of practical experience. 

We welcome submissions in the following formats:

*	**Presentation summaries**: Short-form summary (max. 2 pages LNCS) of the content of presentations on work that is at an early stage and either addresses an open issue or reports experience in the Overture or INTO-CPS domains.  
*	**Tool reports**: Shorter papers focusing on initial results in developing and applying the tools and formalisms, with a view to receiving community feedback ahead of a full paper (to a future workshop or other venue). Tool reports should not exceed 8 pages LNCS and should include a link to (e.g. GitHub), or instructions for, accessing the tool / model being reported on.
*	**Full papers**: Longer papers reporting more mature results. Full papers should not exceed 15 pages LNCS.

Each tool report or full paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the PC. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to:

*	Reports of applications of VDM or INTO-CPS-related technology, especially reports of industrial use.
*	Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations, and case studies of VDM or INTO-CPS technology, whether yet implemented or not.
*	Papers on foundations and methodology for VDM or INTO-CPS, including the description of real-time, cyber-physical systems, digital twins and systems-of-systems.
*	Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
*	Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice.
*	Papers on extensions of VDM-related tools including Visual Studio Code, INTO-CPS assets and ViennaTalk.

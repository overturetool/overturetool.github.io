## The Original CALL FOR PAPERS

> The 14th Overture Workshop
> will be held on the 7th of November 2016 in connection with the Formal Methods 2016 symposium

This is the 14th in a series of workshops on the Vienna Development Method (VDM) seen in the open-source Overture setting. Although VDM is one of the oldest formal methods to have enjoyed a level of industry use, it nevertheless has a lively and youthful research community, which has grown up around the development of the Overture open tools platform. On top of the Overture platform the Crescendo and Symphony tools from respectively the DESTECS and COMPASS projects. Currently the Overture tools are being further extended inside the INTO-CPS project (see <http://into-cps.au.dk/>) as well as in the TEMPO experiment (see <http://tempoproject.eu/>) supported by the CPSE-Labs project (see <http://www.cpse-labs.eu/>). The platform provides a vehicle for activity in modelling and analysis technology including static analysis, interpreters, test generation and execution support and model checking. The growth of this community has been greatly assisted by the Overture workshop series.

There is a long tradition for having these workshops co-located with the FM symposia (2005, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2012). We did not collocate with the FM’14 symposium in Singapore since we felt that it would be hard to gather enough attendance so instead John Fitzgerald, Ken Pierce and Peter Gorm Larsen delivered a Crescendo tutorial (see <http://crescendotool.org/>). Proceedings of previous workshops may be obtained from <http://www.overturetool.org/>.

### Call for Papers

Our workshop aims to provide a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in formal modelling and analysis using VDM and its family of associated formalisms including extensions for distributed and real-time systems. We strongly welcome contributions on the development of tools for VDM as well as developments in foundations and reports of practical experience. The page limit is 15 pages. 

The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to: 

* Reports of applications of VDM technology, especially reports of industrial use. 
* Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations and case studies of support tools for VDM, whether or not implemented on the Overture open tools platform. 
* Papers on the foundations and methodology associated with VDM and its extensions, including the description of real-time and distributed systems. 
* Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
* Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice. 
* Papers on extensions of Overture including Crescendo, Symphony and VDMPad.

### Important Dates

* 1st September 2016: Submission deadline for abstract of workshop papers (submit at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=overture14)
* 7th September 2016: Submission deadline for full workshop papers
* 1st October 2016: Notification to workshop paper authors
* 28th October 2016: Final version of workshop papers due

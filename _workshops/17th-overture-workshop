# THE 17TH OVERTURE WORKSHOP: New Capabilities and Applications for Model-based
# Systems Engineering
The 17th Overture Workshop will be held between 7-11 of October 2019 (TBC) in
association with the the [3rd World Congress on Formal Methods
(FM2019)](http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt/).

The 17th Overture Workshop is the latest in a series of workshops around the
Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and
related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best established formal
methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and
practitioners in academia and industry has grown around the modelling
languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT, CML) and tools (VDMTools, Overture,
Crescendo, Symphony, and the INTO-CPS chain). Together, these provide a
platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes static
and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking.

Previous workshops have been invaluable in encouraging both new and
established members of the community in their work, and helping to determine
priorities and future directions. Proceedings of former workshops are
available at http://www.overturetool.org/.

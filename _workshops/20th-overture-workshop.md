# CALL FOR PAPERS

The 20th Overture Workshop is the latest in a series of workshops around the
Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and
related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the best established formal
methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and
practitioners in academia and industry has grown around the modelling
languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT) and tools (including VDMTools, Overture,
INTO-CPS, ViennaTalk, VDMJ and VDM VSCode). Together, these provide a
platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes IDEs, static
and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking.

Previous workshops have been invaluable in encouraging both new and
established members of the community in their work, and helping to determine
priorities and future directions. Proceedings of former workshops are
available at <https://www.overturetool.org/>.



### Important Dates 

25 April 2022: Submission of abstracts of papers

02 May   2022: Submission deadline for papers

15 June  2022: Notification to authors

24 June  2022: Final version of papers due

05 July  2022: Workshop


## Call
Our workshop provides a forum for discussing and advancing the state of the art in formal modelling and analysis using VDM and its family of associated formalisms including extensions for distributed VDM and real-time systems. We strongly welcome contributions on the development of tools for, as well as developments in, foundations and reports of practical experience. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the PC, must use the Springer LNCS format, and should not exceed 15 pages in length. 

The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to:
* Reports of applications of VDM technology, especially reports of industrial use.
* Papers describing requirements, designs, implementations and case studies of support tools for VDM, whether or not implemented in the VDM-related tools.
* Papers on the foundations and methodology associated with VDM and its extensions, including the description of real-time, cyber-physical systems, digital twins and systems-of-systems.
* Papers combining VDM with other notations and tools.
* Position papers on VDM and its promotion in industry practice.
* Papers on extensions of VDM-related tools including Overture, INTO-CPS and ViennaTalk.

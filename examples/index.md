# Examples

We maintain a large database of illustrative examples, coming from a
wide variety of sources and application areas. These examples can be
used as inspiration for your own modeling work. We also use these
examples to validate changes made to the tools.  All examples are
included in our continuous build environment such that both model and
tool consistency is checked.

VDM examples are available in all of the three dialects. On these
pages, you find a detailed overview of each example. You can also
download a bundle of all examples for each dialect:

<!--If you have questions on these examples, you can either post a
question on
[StackOverflow using the VDM++ tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b)
or [send us an email](mailto:info@overturetool.org).  If you have an
example to contribute to our collection, we are very happy to hear
from you!-->

A guide that explains how to import the projects are avaliable at [Importing External Zipped Projects into Overture]({{ site.url }}/examples/importing-external-projects.html).

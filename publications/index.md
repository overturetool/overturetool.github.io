## Type-setting VDM Specifications

* LaTeX and LaTeX2e macros are available to help you write VDM-SL specifications in the ISO Standard Language's mathematical syntax. They have been developed and are maintained by the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Read the [README](ftp://ftp.npl.co.uk/pub/latex/macros/vdm-sl/README) and get the downloads from [here](ftp://ftp.npl.co.uk/pub/latex/macros/vdm-sl/). You will need a large version of TeX to use the macros in any serious way. The contact at NPL is Graeme I Parkin, (Graeme.Parkin@npl.co.uk).

title="An empirical comparison of formalisms for modelling and analysis of dynamic reconfiguration of dependable systems",
journal="Formal Aspects of Computing",
year="2017",
pages="1--57",
abstract="This paper uses a case study to evaluate empirically three formalisms of different kinds for their suitability for the modelling and analysis of dynamic reconfiguration of dependable systems. The requirements on an ideal formalism for dynamic software reconfiguration are defined. The reconfiguration of an office workflow for order processing is described, and the requirements on the reconfiguration of the workflow are defined. The workflow is modelled using the Vienna Development Method (VDM), conditional partial order graphs (CPOGs), and the basic Calculus of Communicating Systems for dynamic process reconfiguration (basic CCSdp), and verification of the reconfiguration requirements is attempted using the models. The formalisms are evaluated according to their ability to model the reconfiguration of the workflow, to verify the requirements on the workflow's reconfiguration, and to meet the requirements on an ideal formalism.",

abstract="When a system specified using the Vienna Development Method (VDM) is realised using code-generation, no guarantees are currently made about the correctness of the generated code. In this paper, we improve code-generation of VDM models by taking contract-based elements such as invariants and pre- and postconditions into account during the code-generation process. The contract-based elements of the Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) are translated into corresponding constructs in the Java Modelling Language (JML) and used to validate the generated code against the properties of the VDM model. VDM-SL and JML are both Design-by-Contract (DbC) languages, with the difference that VDM-SL supports abstract modelling and system specification, while JML is used for detailed specification of Java classes and interfaces. We describe the semantic differences between the contract-based elements of VDM-SL and JML and formulate the translation as a set of rules. We further demonstrate how dynamic JML assertion checks can be used to ensure the consistency of VDM's subtypes when a model is code-generated. The translator is fully automated and produces JML-annotated Java programs that can be checked for correctness using JML tools.",

abstract = "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) often operate in a critical context where it is crucial that they behave as intended. However, the heterogeneous nature of CPSs makes them inherently challenging to develop. To assist in the development process, one can perform co-simulation, where models of constituents of a CPS are coupled to jointly simulate the full system. The challenge herein is to combine heterogeneous formalisms in a sound fashion and address practical needs such as stability, performance, platform compatibility and so forth. To address this, Maestro is a tool for co-simulation using models adhering to the Functional Mock-up Interface standard for co-simulation. Its development was driven by needs from different industry domains such as railways, agriculture, building automation and automotive. It supports both a fixed and variable constraint-based iteration scheme along with platform distribution capabilities. The tool is open-source as an attempt to increase adoption of co-simulation and encourage researchers to collaborate. Maestro has been validated by industry through application in the aforementioned domains. It is a step in the direction of the two-folded long-term goals: ensure trustworthy co-simulation results and make co-simulation a technology taken for granted."
